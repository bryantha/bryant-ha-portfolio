## Marketing Strategy: Driving Engagement through Multi-Channel Campaigns

### Objective
To increase adoption of Bank of America’s **Mobile Banking App**, used by 41 million active digital banking users, by targeting millennials and Gen Z customers with personalized digital campaigns.

### Approach
- **Channel Selection**: Utilized a multi-channel approach, including social media (Instagram, TikTok), email marketing, and in-app notifications.
- **Content Strategy**: Created short-form video content showcasing app features like Zelle payments and budgeting tools, tailored to younger audiences.
- **A/B Testing**: Tested two email subject lines (“Manage Your Money with Ease” vs. “Unlock Smarter Banking”) to optimize open rates.

### Visualization: Campaign Engagement Metrics
Below is a bar chart comparing engagement rates across channels.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Simulated engagement data
engagement <- data.frame(
  Channel = c("Social Media", "Email", "In-App Notifications"),
  Engagement_Rate = c(12, 18, 25)
)

# Bar plot
ggplot(engagement, aes(x = Channel, y = Engagement_Rate, fill = Channel)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Engagement Rates by Digital Channel",
    x = "Channel",
    y = "Engagement Rate (%)",
    caption = "Simulated data for illustrative purposes"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Social Media" = "#1abc9c", "Email" = "#3498db", "In-App Notifications" = "#2c3e50"))
