# Data-Driven Marketing Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data-driven marketing projects, where I highlight my expertise in **Market Operation Analysis** at **Bank of America**. Below, I present case studies that demonstrate how I leverage data analytics to optimize marketing strategies, improve operational efficiencies, and drive measurable business outcomes.
## Case Study 1: Optimizing Customer Segmentation for Consumer Banking

### Objective
In Bank of Americaâ€™s Consumer Banking segment, which serves approximately 69 million clients, the goal was to enhance customer segmentation for targeted marketing campaigns. The challenge was to identify high-value customers for cross-selling credit card and mortgage products.[](https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2023/11/bofa-global-research-calls-2024--the-year-of-the-landing--.html)

### Approach
- **Data Collection**: Analyzed transactional data from 41 million active digital banking users, including spending patterns and account types.[](https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2022/01/bank-of-america-launches-cashpro-forecasting.html)
- **Analysis**: Used clustering techniques (K-means in R) to segment customers based on demographics, transaction frequency, and account balances.
- **Campaign Design**: Developed personalized email marketing campaigns for each segment, focusing on credit card offers for high-spenders and mortgage promotions for stable-income clients.

### Data Visualization
Below is a visualization of customer segments based on spending behavior.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Simulated data for customer segments
set.seed(123)
customers <- data.frame(
  Spending = rnorm(1000, mean = 5000, sd = 1500),
  Transactions = rnorm(1000, mean = 20, sd = 5),
  Segment = sample(c("High-Value", "Moderate", "Low-Value"), 1000, replace = TRUE)
)

# Scatter plot
ggplot(customers, aes(x = Spending, y = Transactions, color = Segment)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Customer Segmentation by Spending and Transactions",
    x = "Monthly Spending ($)",
    y = "Monthly Transactions",
    caption = "Simulated data for illustrative purposes"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("High-Value" = "#2c3e50", "Moderate" = "#1abc9c", "Low-Value" = "#e74c3c"))
```
